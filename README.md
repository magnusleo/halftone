# Halftone.js

## What is a halftone?
A halftone is to use small elements, such as uniformely colored but differently sized circles, to make out a continuous image when viewed from a distance. Read more on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halftone).

## What is this?
This is a piece of code that generates a halftone version of your image source of choice. It is written in TypeScript and uses SVG as output.

## Is there a demo?
There sure is! https://magnusleo.github.io/halftone/

## Is this production ready?
Nope. I did this for fun and learning.
